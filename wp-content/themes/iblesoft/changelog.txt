Changelog

ver. 1.4.3  [28/04/2016]

 - UPDATE: Icons Library functionality that allowed uploading your own icons font was dropped, due to lots of support tickets containing unexpected issues with several non WP-friendly hosts. Please make sure that you reset the 'Theme Options > Icons Library' section after update. The feature will continue to work, serving our preset libraries but any custom libraries that may added will not work . Existing customers that find this functionality crucial for their projects, may address to our support to provide them a theme-child patch that will recover the feature as it worked until now. Thank you very much for your understanding.
